Defects Found:

Door.java: When using the function enter, the case where the room the door connects does not lead to current room is not checked. 
An error is now thrown if this happen. This was found in test EnterNoAccessRoom() within DoorTest.java. In the actual behavior the player 
doesn't move anywhere. The expected behavior is that information of the room is displayed to the player. Since the player hasn't moved an 
error should indicate that an illegal action has been attempted.
