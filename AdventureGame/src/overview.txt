Specific contributions by each person:
	- Bolin Liu: Wrote Room and Player Test. Added Comments for all tests. Located defects. Food suppliment!
	- Kerry McKean:  Fixed bugs from last assignment, updated AdventureGame, wrote tests which ended up being unnecessary, provided 		moral and technical support
	- David Sahud: Updated defects found in door.java within overview.txt. Set up user stories and tasks in A3-US-1.txt.
	- Xuehao Hu: added doorTest and corresponding comments, also did some bugs fixing, investigation about git commands
Defects Found:
Door.java: When using the function enter, the case where the room the door connects does not lead to current room is not checked. 
An error is now thrown if this happen. This was found in test EnterNoAccessRoom() within DoorTest.java. In the actual behavior the player 
doesn't move anywhere. The expected behavior is that information of the room is displayed to the player. Since the player hasn't moved an 
error should indicate that an illegal action has been attempted.
